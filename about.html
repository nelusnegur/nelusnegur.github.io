          My name is Nelu Snegur. I am an enthusiastic software engineer that loves solving problems, building things and
          exploring the universe. My interests comprise distributed systems, databases, high performance computing and optimizations.
          I believe that the most performant and reliable software systems are those where software and hardware are designed to work well together.
          My favorite programming language is Rust.

          Why am I here?

        <p>
          <em>Life is exploration!</em> It is a journey guided by curiosity of discovering the universe
          we are a part of. As I walk through life, I discover and learn new things that delight me. I would
          like to share some of these learnings, hoping they may bring the same delight to other
          people as well.
