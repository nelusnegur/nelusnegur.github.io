                    My name is Nelu Snegur. I am a software engineer, that loves building things that help
                    and improve people's lives.
                    I am passionate about everything computer related, especially about distributed systems
                    and high performance computing. Also, I am interested in physics and mathematics.

                    <em>Life is exploration!</em> It is a journey, guided by curiosity, of discovering the universe
                    we are a part of. As I walk through life, I discover and learn new things that fascinate me.
                    I would like to share some of these discoveries, hoping they may be useful to other people as well.
