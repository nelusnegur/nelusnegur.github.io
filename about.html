                <p>
                    My name is Nelu Snegur. I am a software engineer that loves solving problems, building things and
                    exploring the universe.
                    I am passionate about everything computer related, especially about distributed systems
                    and high performance computing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <em>Life is exploration!</em> It is a journey guided by curiosity of discovering the universe
                    we are a part of. As I walk through life, I discover and learn new things that delights me. I would
                    like to share some of these learnings, hoping they may bring the same delight to other
                    people as well.
