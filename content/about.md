My name is Nelu Snegur. I am an enthusiastic software engineer that loves solving problems, building things and
exploring the universe. My interests comprise distributed systems, databases, high performance computing and optimizations.
I believe that the most performant and reliable software systems are those where software and hardware are designed to work well together.
