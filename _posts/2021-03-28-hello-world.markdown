Hey there! This is my first blog post, and because of that I will write the simplest program, "Hello world",
in my favorite programming languages!
You can find a short description about me and why this blog exists on the [About](/about) page.

My favorite programming languages are Rust and Scala. Currently, I am working as a software engineer
with Scala. During Covid-19 pandemic, I have started learning Rust and it became my favorite programming language.

The "Hello world" program in Scala would look like this:
{% highlight scala %}
object App {
    def main(args: List[String]) = {
        println("Hello World!")
    }
}{% endhighlight %}

In Rust, it is simpler:
{% highlight rust %}
fn main() {
    println!("Hello World!");
}
{% endhighlight %}
